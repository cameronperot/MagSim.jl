# MagSim.jl

This is a Julia package for simulating ferromagnetic systems, e.g. simulation of the Ising model with the Metropolis algorithm.
More information on the underlying theory and motivation can be found in my [blog series on simulating magnetism](https://cameronperot.com/physics/2019/12/29/simulating-magnetism-part-1.html).

This is currently a work in progress, more models/algorithms and documentation will be added in the future.
